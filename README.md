# Deft response block #

Provides polling and chat that update live without reloading main activity as
well and text, audio and video sharing.

Teachers may configure a number of questions or prompts in the block
and change the visibilities and other conditions of the items. Comments
may also be enabled to conduct discussions.

An external service is available to enable updating the contents in users
browsers via the websocket protocol. The service is free for testing
and limited usage, but will be capped for larger sites without a service
agreement in the future. The service is linked as an External Tool (LTI),
but user information is not shared with the service other than what is
necessary to provide connection i.e IP number associated with block's
context. Alternatively the plugin can be configured to use a self hosted
Jitsi server as a backend.

The service will remain free for smaller sites, but sites with larger usage
may be require a service agreement to prevent usage caps.
